# Assist setting up a Python virtualenv that can access the Raspberry Pi camera
# (using libcamera / picamera2). The script is conservative: it checks for
# required binaries and suggests installing system packages with sudo.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/setup-pi-camera-venv.sh [--no-install]
#
# Options:
#   --no-install  : do not attempt to install system packages (just create venv)
