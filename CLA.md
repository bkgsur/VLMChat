Subject: Summary of Our Open Source Contribution Strategy

To prepare our project for open-source contributions, we've established a legal and governance framework. The primary goal is to encourage community involvement while ensuring we have the necessary rights to use the entire codebase in a future commercial product.

The strategy is based entirely on common practices used by major open-source projects and companies like Google, Meta, and the Apache Software Foundation.

Here are the key decisions:

1. We will use a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

Decision: All contributors must sign a CLA before their code can be merged.

Reason: Our project's MIT license allows others to use our code, but it doesn't give us the right to re-license code contributed by others. The CLA is a separate agreement that explicitly grants us a broad, irrevocable license to the contributions. This is the legal mechanism that allows us to include community code in our closed-source commercial offerings. This is the industry-standard solution to this exact problem.

2. We have selected the Apache Individual CLA (ICLA).

Decision: We will use the standard Apache ICLA template. This is a license grant, not a copyright assignment, so contributors keep ownership of their work.

Reason: The Apache ICLA is the most widely used and trusted CLA in the world. It is recognized by developers and corporate legal teams alike. It grants us the critical rights to sublicense code and also includes a patent license to protect the project from future patent claims by a contributor. By using this standard, we appear professional and fair, which helps attract contributors.

3. We will adopt an Apache-style governance model.

Decision: The project will be run as a meritocracy, where trusted "committers" review and approve contributions.

Reason: This model, known as "The Apache Way," is a proven method for building a healthy and sustainable community. It ensures quality control while providing a clear path for dedicated contributors to gain more responsibility.

In summary, this strategy establishes a professional, legally sound framework that aligns us with best practices. It protects our ability to commercialize the project while creating an open and welcoming environment for community contributors.
