# [Project Name] Governance Model

This document outlines the governance model for the [Project Name] project. Our goal is to create a vibrant, community-driven project that is open, transparent, and sustainable. This model is inspired by "The Apache Way."

## Roles

### Users
Users are the most important part of our community. They are anyone who uses the software. We value feedback from our users and encourage them to participate in the community by reporting bugs or suggesting features.

### Contributors
A Contributor is anyone who makes a contribution to the project. This includes submitting a Pull Request, filing a detailed bug report, improving documentation, or helping others in the community. Everyone starts as a contributor.

### Committers
Committers are contributors who have earned write access to the repository. They have a proven track record of making valuable, high-quality contributions and have earned the trust of the project.

**Responsibilities:**
* Review and merge Pull Requests from other contributors.
* Maintain the quality and stability of the codebase.
* Guide the technical direction of the project.
* Participate in community discussions and mentor new contributors.

## Becoming a Committer

Committers are chosen through a merit-based process. The path to becoming a committer is straightforward: contribute to the project in a sustained and meaningful way.

Existing committers will look for contributors who:
* Make high-quality contributions (code, documentation, etc.).
* Provide thoughtful and constructive code reviews.
* Are helpful and respectful in community discussions.
* Demonstrate a solid understanding of the project's goals and architecture.

When a contributor has demonstrated these qualities over time, an existing committer can nominate them for committership. The nomination will be discussed and voted on privately by the current committers.

## Decision Making

The project operates on a principle of consensus.

* **Minor Changes:** For most changes, such as bug fixes and minor features, approval from one or more committers on a Pull Request is sufficient.
* **Major Changes:** For significant changes to the architecture, public APIs, or project direction, a committer should start a discussion via a GitHub Issue or Discussion. The goal is to reach a "lazy consensus," where the proposal is considered accepted if there are no strong objections after a reasonable period.
* **Voting:** If consensus cannot be reached, the committers may hold a formal vote. In such cases, a proposal passes with a majority of `+1` votes and no `-1` votes (vetoes). A `-1` vote must be accompanied by a clear technical justification.

This governance model is a living document and may be updated by the project committers as the community grows and evolves.
